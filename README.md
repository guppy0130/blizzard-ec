# Blizzard Extra Credit Coding Challenge - SRE Intern

1. Write a web application in your language of choice that returns the current date/time in JSON.   
2. Write a simple test application that will query this “API” X times per second and record success/failure/TTLB (Time to last byte).
3. Perform a blue-green deploy with the method/technology of your choosing while the test application is running and demonstrate there were no failed requests.
    1. Go from a single instance of v1 to a single instance of v2 gracefully.
